# WP Fast Login

Do NOT use this plugin on a production website. This plugin should only be used on a local development site because it allows logging in as a user without providing the password.

This WordPress development plugin allows logging into directly from the login page (without entering a password or typing a username). The username is chosen from a drop-down menu.
